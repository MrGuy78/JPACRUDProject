# JPACRUDProject

## Overview
A fullstack website of mountains I've summitted and various data about them. Data include name, elevation, date of first summit, date of my first summit, location (GPS) and the number of deaths on the mountain.


## Technologies Used
DAO, DAOImpl, Controller, jsp's, MySQL workbench, MAMP, html/css, Gradle, JUnit testing


## Lessons Learned
Piecing together the various parts of the puzzle was difficult, even overwhelming at times. 

href's are GET methods by default; to use a POST method takes a form-action.

I finally started using ChatGPT to find errors in my code. I had resisted using it because I wanted to learn coding "the hard way" but it was pretty instrumental in this assignment.
